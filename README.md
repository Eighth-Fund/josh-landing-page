## Developing

You'll obviously want to modify the content of this landing page to suit your next cool thing. Here are a few instructions on how:

#### Google Form

The most important aspect of your landing page is probably the form input. You need to see if your audience is picking up what you're putting down!

#### Hero

The Hero is basically what you first see when the page is loaded.

#### Features

I'm using gif's to show off the features but you can also just display static images.

If you like the gif's, I recommend using [giphy capture](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture) to screen record your features.

#### Google Analytics
