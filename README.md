![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=react-landing-page1)

With this guide you should get an awesome landing page up and running in 5 minutes!

Please ping me if you decide to use this so I can create a gallery of some sort :)

If you have ideas on how to improve this, issues or PR's are much appreciated!

## Deploying

It is best practice to deploy first, and then develop second. Let's get started!


1.  #### Fork this repository

* Just hit the "Fork" button in the top right-hand corner of this Github repo.

2.  #### Setup Heroku

* Sign up for an account at [heroku](https://heroku.com/).
* Create a new Heroku app with a name you like

3.  #### Deploy to Heroku

* Go to the "Deploy" section in the project nav-bar
* Under "Deployment Method" click "Github"
* Under "Connect to Github", enter in your forked Github repository 
* (optional) Under "Automatic deploys", click "Enable Automatic Deploys" (this will ensure that every new commit under the main branch will automatically trigger a redeploy)
* Under "Manual deploy" click "Deploy Branch"

  \* If there is enough interest, I will add a guide on how to hook up a custom domain    

## Developing

You'll obviously want to modify the content of this landing page to suit your next cool thing. Here are a few instructions on how:


#### Google Form

The most important aspect of your landing page is probably the form input. You need to see if your audience is picking up what you're putting down!


#### Hero

The Hero is basically what you first see when the page is loaded.

#### Features


I'm using gif's to show off the features but you can also just display static images.

If you like the gif's, I recommend using [giphy capture](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture) to screen record your features.


#### Google Analytics
