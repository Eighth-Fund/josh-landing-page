                <p>Ideally, you'd ask your readers for <span className="highlight"><b>ideas and feedback</b></span>.</p>
                <p>But viewers come from many different channels including Twitter, newsletters, backlinks, subscribers, organic traffic.</p>
                <p>So your feedback is scattered across many platforms, communities, and comment sections.</p>
